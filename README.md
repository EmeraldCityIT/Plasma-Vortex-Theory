ABSTRACT
Plasma Vortex Theory is the engineered application of known sciences to create efficient velocity
during spaceflight using electricity and propellant gas. Oscillation of granulate and liquid reagents 
using simple harmonic motion has been shown to excite particles to form geometric patterns when using
calibrated frequencies discovered by the late Dr. Hans Jenny. Calibration methods will be used to attain 
vortex formations in the reagents Lycopodium, Sulfur Hexafluoride, CO2 and Xenon. Frequencies which form 
vortex patterns in Lycopodium powder using known methods will be used to excite Sulfur Hexafluoride 
(density 6.17 kg/m3), at incremental partial pressures. Air-filled mass objects will be used to observe 
acceleration, force and velocity data for a dense gas during oscillation and vortex formation. 
Xenon gas (density 5.761 kg/m3) will be ionized by external electrode field before, during and after 
vortex formations are created using acoustic measures.
